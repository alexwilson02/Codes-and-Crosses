# Codes-and-Crosses

Our tic-tac-toe project gives a fresh twist to the classic game by swapping out the usual "X" and "O" markers for "A" and "M" which is the beginning initials for the creators of this project, adding a unique touch to player identity. Weâ€™re also building in an AI opponent, which will provide a more challenging gameplay experience which will allow  users to go head-to-head against a computer that can strategize and react. Coded in Python, this project combines creativity with technical skills, making it a fun and practical way to explore game design, AI, and programming logic.
