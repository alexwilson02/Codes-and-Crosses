# Codes and Crosses

Our tic-tac-toe project gives a fresh twist to the classic game by swapping out the usual "X" and "O" markers for "A" and "M," adding a unique touch to player identity. Weâ€™re also building in an AI opponent, which will provide a challenging gameplay experience, allowing users to go head-to-head against a computer that can strategize and react. Coded in Python, this project combines creativity with technical skills, making it a fun and practical way to explore game design, AI, and programming logic.
